Feature: Is it Friday yet?
  Everybody wants to know when it's Friday

  Scenario: Sunday isn't Friday
    Given today is Sunday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told "Nope"

  Scenario: Friday is Friday
    Given today is Friday
    When I ask whether it's Friday yet
    Then I should be told

    #In some version Scenario can be used interchangeably with Example   (Scenario == Example)

  #Occasionally youâ€™ll find yourself repeating the same Given steps in all of the scenarios in a Feature.
  #
  #Since it is repeated in every scenario, this is an indication that those steps are not essential to describe the scenarios; they are incidental details. You can literally move such Given steps to the background, by grouping them under a Background section.
  #
  #A Background allows you to add some context to the scenarios that follow it. It can contain one or more Given steps, which are run before each scenario, but after any Before hooks.
